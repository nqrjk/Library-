This is one of the first projects out there using JavaScript. I'll try to use objects and such a tricky thing as "Inheritance".
My goals:
- understand how objects store information;
- how we can get access to info from objects;
- how inheritance works;
- how to create a module window;

I hope it will work well and I'll get better in it. Right now I understand literally n-o-t-h-i-n-g, that's why I procrastinated.
